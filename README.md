# Introduction to *HyperSpy*, *LumiSpy* and *eXSpy*

> **Spectroscopy Data Analysis in Python Using [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org)**

Tutorial for the **eBEAM2024 school on nano-optics with free electrons**

> Aussois, September 1-13, 2024

---------------

**Dear attendants of the eBEAM summer school,**

we are happy to introduce you to data analysis using [HyperSpy](https://hyperspy.org) and its extensions [LumiSpy](https://lumispy.org) and [exSPy](https://hyperspy.org/exspy) at the eBEAM 2024. 

To follow the interactive tutorials and make maximum use of the limited time available, we kindly ask you to bring your laptop and already install the **[HyperSpy-bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/)** matching your system before coming to the school. The [HyperSpy bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/) ships a python environment including all relevant packages.

## Installing HyperSpy

Follow the [installation guide for the HyperSpy bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/install.html).

If you already have python installed on your system and prefer not installing the bundle, we recommend creating a new environment for the tutorial and installing at least the following packages using pip or conda:

``hyperspy, exspy, lumispy, hyperspy-gui-ipywidgets, jupyter-lab, numba``

Otherwise, have a look at the full [list of packages included in the HyperSpy-bundle](https://hyperspy.org/hyperspy-bundle/index.html#included-software-and-libraries).
